# USFiresMetadata

## Background:
I am a forester for the North Carolina Forest Service, as such a majority of my job is ensuring water quality is maintained as well as acting as a fire response resource in the event of a wildfire within the state.  This position also allows me to dispatch as a casual hire to the US Forest Service and develop my career in a system of taskbooks and new jobs as I grow.  The reason I wanted to make this map directly was it is shows a major interest and passion of mine, and can be a useful resource to show changes in the landscape across America.

## Who?
This map is for anyone who is looking for a representation of fire activity in the past years.  Ideal targets with that are legistlators, environmental advocates, and other people in this working field.

## What?
This map displays data taken from NIFC (National Interagency Fire Center) website and cataagorizes it by size.  Size of a wildfire is often one of the easiest indicators of severity and complexity gaining more traction publicly and needing more resources to contain.  

## When?
The main reason target data was taken from 2020-2022 is that they are some of the most complete data sets in recent years.  I also had to narrow my scope as the massive amounts of shapefile data did take extra time to load in the beginning and could be cumbersome to the server hosting.

## Where?
The site displays information for just the United States.  Personally it is the most consequential to my career and events happening to me on a regular basis, as well as many of the intended targets for the project.

## Why?
I wanted this project to be both personal and useful.  This is something I can take to my fellow firefighters and use it as a presentational piece.  Though not the most original way to display this information I would like to have this webpage grow and change over my career to show where I have been personally.

## How?
My first task was taking the base data from NIFC and dividing it into multiple layers (one per year).  After the data was broken down into acceptable sizes I setup the code to pull the data and update the legend after changes in the dropdown menu.  This display allows users to see that the fire landscape is constantly changing over time.

## After?
My goal for this page after the class is to heavily incorperate the project into my portfolio.  My intent is to create a new tab in the dropdown menu that holds the shapefiles of fires I have personally been present at and use it as a biography of sorts tracking my career and interesting events.
